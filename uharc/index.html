	<h1>Official UHARC CMD Homepage</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="uharc-cmd-install.exe" target="_blank">Download UHARC CMD</a><br />
		Latest Version: 2.1.1.2 (<a href="changelog.html">Click here to see latest changes</a>)
	</p>
	<p>
		Now compatible with x64 editions of Windows.
	</p>
	<h3>What is UHARC?</h3>
	<p>
		UHARC v0.6b Created by Uwe Herklotz<br />
		Free Closed Source Software<br />
		It is a super  compressor and I've been able to compress as much as 1.3GB of uncompressed data down to 180MB.
	</p>
	<h3>What is UHARC CMD?</h3>
	<p>
		UHARC CMD Created by Sam Gleske<br />
		FREE (as in beer) and open source software!<br />
		UHARC CMD integrates the command line compressor UHARC v0.6b, created by Uwe Herklotz, into the Windows shell. UHARC CMD is unique from other UHARC GUI's in that it doesn't use any compiled source code to interface UHARC with the Windows Shell.  It uses a set of batch scripts.  The installer and UHARC CMD settings are compiled using NSIS.  It's as easy as right clicking on files/folders and clicking  compress!<br />
	</p>
	<h3>Special features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Create an SFX (self-extracting archive) from compressed archives  and send them to friends/family/colleagues. They do not need the  software installed to extract it which is the advantage of having an  SFX.</li>
		<li>Create password encrypted archives to keep your private things private.</li>
		<li>Make a Secure SFX from password encrypted archives that  require a password to be extracted. Does not need the UHARC CMD  software and can be sent to friends/family/colleagues without worry!</li>
		<li><a href="http://forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=2084891" target="_blank">Here is the source for the SFX's.</a> Now you can create your own custom SFX modules.</li>
		<li>Includes support for decompressing older UHARC 0.4 archives.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Inspirations</h3>
	<p>
		What inspired me to make UHARC CMD?<br />
		Well I first discovered UHARC 0.4 a couple years back it was/is an  AMAZING compressor. Then I stumbled upon UHARC GUI 2.0 created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080828115044/http://brhack.net/" target="_blank">BRHACK</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605210209/http://mulder.brhack.net/" target="_blank">MuldeR</a>.  I felt this software was also stellar and it is also a GUI front end  for UHARC 0.4 which is the same time when I started developing UHARC CMD. My 1.0 software addressed issues that UHARC GUI did not.<br /><br />
		Then I discovered UHARC 0.6a which was simply even more AMAZING and  compressed even more than UHARC 0.4. It is around the same time I also  discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605210209/http://mulder.brhack.net/#uharcgui" target="_blank">UHARC GUI 3.06</a> created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605210209/http://mulder.brhack.net/" target="_blank">MuldeR</a>.  This is after I came out with UHARC CMD 1.3 (Build 12). <br /><br />
		I believe UHARC CMD had a base of UHARC 0.4 up until version 1.2. And  then support for UHARC 0.6b as well as SFX creationg was included in  1.3 (Build 12). Encryption for archives and SFXs was the big change for  2.0. Now to come is UHARC CMD 2.1!<br />
	</p>
	<h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
	<p>
		I've gotten a few emails of concerned people wondering why they've seen in the batch scripts the following code:<br />
		<tt>ping -n 4 127.0.0.1 >NUL</tt><br />
		That ping is not actually connecting to the internet. 127.0.0.1 is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback">loopback IP address</a> and is used to troubleshoot your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_card">NIC</a>.<br />
		I'm not actually troubleshooting your NIC.  The Windows Command Prompt does not have a sleep function so I am using that little hacker technique to pause the batch script so it sleeps.  In particular that batch command is pausing the script for 4000ms or 4 seconds.
