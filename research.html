<h1>Current Research Projects</h1>
<p>These are projects of mine that are currently active that I modify the program at least every 4-5 months.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="http://sf.net/projects/webtechtools" target="_blank">Sourceforge project page</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://ekeyfinder.sf.net/" target="_blank">Enchanted Keyfinder</a> is a Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder fork. It is a utility that retrieves the product key used to install Windows from your registry or from an unbootable Windows installation. It works on Windows 9X, ME, NT/2K/XP, and Vista/Win7 and for other software.  It works for Microsoft Office Versions: XP, 2003, 2007, 2010.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/proxytest/" target="_blank">Proxy Tester and wpad.dat generator</a> is a proxy list tester and checker.  It can determine if an anonymous proxy is truly working and then generate a wpad.dat file which allows your browser to randomly switch between random anonymous proxies as you browse.  You must give it an option to generate the wpad file.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/registrykeyremo/" target="_blank">Registry Key Remover</a> is designed to read the compare logs from RegShot and then revert the changes made to your system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=213893&amp;package_id=261186&amp;release_id=578695" target="_blank">Scientific Calculator WebUI</a> (<a href="http://sam.gleske.net/firecalc/" onclick="window.open(this.href,'','width=380,height=320,resizable=yes');return false;">click here to see demo</a>) - Researching different math based techniques in JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are hundreds of smaller projects I have involving the NSIS script language and other languages.
    </li>
</ol>

<h1>Previous Research Projects</h1>
<p>These are research projects that I have either abandoned or completed.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Autorun.inf_Generator" target="_blank">Autorun.inf Generator</a> - A small program I wrote to easily generate advanced Autorun.inf files for CD, DVD, and USB Flash content.
    </li>
    <li>
        FolderView UI - A new user interface for viewing files on a server.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=213893&amp;package_id=290987" target="_blank">FolderView UI SEHS</a> - A web based help content system custom designed to run extremely fast for low bandwidth systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=213893&amp;package_id=273933&amp;release_id=595652" target="_blank">GEM Encryption</a> - Gleske Encryption Method Encryption is a system I designed to teach myself different ways of encrypting a string as well as techniques to use when cracking encryption.
    </li>
    <li>
        JSEditor 3.51 - A JavaScript word editor that I modified from an existing one giving it better functionality and more robust features as well as help documentation.  I accidently deleted the programming files and had to revert to a back where I lost six months of work.  From there I lost interest in the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.tapioneer.org/" target="_blank">Pioneer Linux</a> - Initial developer
    </li>
    <li>
        PTU Server/Client - Written in C#, I had a Pan Tilt Unit that needed to be accessed over a great distance. The problem was that it connected to a computer via serial port which is non-routable. This means it could not run across a network which is what needed to be done so I created a custom server to recieve commands from the network and then do some equations and tell the PTU what to do. The custom client was needed since there wasn't anything like the server.
    </li>
    <li>
        Send-Pokemon Control Panel - Firefox extension which manipulates a Facebook Application.
    </li>
    <li>
        Team 9 Research - A team based engineering project (5 engineers, 1 Tech Advisor, 2 Humanities Advisors) which lasted around 8 months.  We had to come up with a design, any design, and go through the process of a professional engineering firm.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="uharc/" target="_blank">UHARC CMD</a> - A shell interface for Windows to utilize the UHARC compressor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once again there are countless of projects that I have finished yet the ones listed are either major or interesting projects.
